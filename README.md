Hey There, welcome to my Repo

#1. Launched a virtual server (Ubuntu) and updated it.
#2. Installed java then defined variable
sudo apt install default-jdk 
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
export PATH=${PATH}:{JAVA_HOME}/bin

#3. Installed git, created git directory and initiated git to track code changes.
#4. Created an index.html file and staged it so it can be ready for commit.
