#Welcome. I created this local git (version control system) to track code changes, staging and commit. At the end of this exercise i will push from local to central GitHub repository.

#1. Launched a virtual server (Ubuntu) and updated it.

#2. Installed java then defined variable for all users 
#sudo apt install default-jdk 
#export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
#export PATH=${PATH}:{JAVA_HOME}/bin

#3. Installed git, created git directory and initiated git to keep record, track code changes staging, and commit.
#/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#brew install git
#create git directory then run git init

#4. Created an index.html and README.md file and staged it so it can be ready for commit.

#5. If you see this it has been pushed the central GitHub repository.
